		 * Okay, so next we immediately throw away the next `length`
		 * random ints from the generator. This seems strange, and is,
		 * so it warrants some explanation.
		 *
		 * The "implementation approach" section in pa5.pdf on page 3
		 * suggests (verbatim):
		 *
		 * 1. To select the initial seed, choose a random position P in
		 *    the source string between L - k, where L is the length of
		 *    the text source. Then, use the source characters between
		 *    (P, P+k) as the random seed.
		 * 2. To choose the next character, find each occurrence of the
		 *    seed in the source and store the character that follows
		 *    it into an ArrayList.
		 *
		 * However, if this is actually implemented, you'll find that
		 * the test suggested on page 4 (roughly called with `java
		 * RandomWriter 15 50 hamlet.txt out.txt 3`) will fail.
		 * Although it produces the correct output, it starts 15
		 * characters (`length`) earlier than it should, implying the
		 * reference implementation used to generate the output
		 * actually compares (or was designed to compare) (P - k, P) as
		 * the source seed, rather than (P, P + k) as the
		 * implementation approach section suggests. The seed matching
		 * the reference implementation can be found by simply adding
		 * `length` to the random seed. However, then we run into
		 * another problem: our output is different! You see, the
		 * pre-computed output requires that output is generated from
		 * the original seed, and that the first `length` elements are
		 * simply thrown out! Rather than actually do this, it works
		 * fine to just generate `length` random integers, advancing
		 * the internal state of our random object just enough to match
		 * the pre-computed output. This is all very silly and, quite
		 * frankly, rather confusing. But it works, and, despite my
		 * best efforts, I cannot find a better way. So here you go.
		 * The tests pass.
		 *
		 * Here are some things that don't work:
		 * 1. Returning the [inx + length]th element instead of the
		 *    [inx]th element
		 * 2. Using (P - k, P) as the seed and checking those elements
		 *    as the sample output implies might be happening
		 *
		 * Side-note: a large portion of the time (about 88% in the
		 * supplied test), there's only one potential possibility to
		 * choose from; calls to the random object can be greatly
		 * reduced by selecting the singular element when only one is
		 * available, but this too creates a different state in the
		 * random object than the test requires.
		 *
		 * IN CONCLUSION: This is bad. I think it's bad. I don't like
		 * it. But it's the only way I can find. Please email if you
		 * know of a better way.
