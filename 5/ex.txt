Now imagine doing a level k analysis by determining the probability with which each character follows every possible sequence of characters of length k. A level 5 analysis of Tom Sawyer for example, would reveal that 'r' follows ''Sawye'' more frequently than any other character. After a level k analysis, you'd be able to produce random Tom Sawyer by always choosing the next character based on the previous k characters (the seed) and the probabilities revealed by the analysis.
